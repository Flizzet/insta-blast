		<h3>Why Should I Buy Followers?</h3>
		<p>
			We live in a world of social media. To this date, more than 90 million people use Instagram on a monthly basis and the numbers are growing by the day! Whether you are an individual, an artist or a small business who wants to expose his work - Instagram is the #1 place. However, there is no use if you have 0 followers, and that's where Instablast comes in! We will give you the likes and followers you deserve and help you grow your social presence!
		</p>
		<h3>Why Should I Buy Likes?</h3>
		<p>
			Having a good number of likes is as important as having a good follower's count. Believe it or not, but this number represents the quality of your image. It is like a review in a sense. Your pictures are great, but in such a big social network as Instagram, your viewers will most likely skip your content without even properly looking at it if you don't have the likes to back it up.
		</p>
		<h3>Why InstaBlast?</h3>
		<p>
			We are a group of experts with many years of experience within the social media and online promotion. If there is one thing we are passionate about - it is to help people get attention in the social media. Ever since Instagram hit the market - we have established and kept an impeccable relationship with our customers. InstaBlast serves over 10,000 customers daily - allow us to serve you, too!
		</p>
		<h3>Is buying Instagram followers and likes worth my money?</h3>
		<p>
			Yes, buying Instagram followers and likes at inexpensive prices is several times worth your money. Most of our customers have reported an incredible increase in brand value, web traffic, and sales after using our real Instagram followers and likes.
		</p>
		<h3>Real-looking followers and likes? Genuinely real?</h3>
		<p>
			Yes, they are genuinely real. Some are regularly active, and some are less active. Many companies/websites advertise with “real followers,” while simply selling inactive bots. With them, you will mostly end up with fake ghost followers.
		</p>
		<h3>Will my account get banned or deleted if I purchase your followers and likes?</h3>
		<p>
			Absolutely not! You are 100% safe with us, that’s a guarantee. We offer only real followers and likes. We’ve offered more than 17 million followers and likes to over 16,000 customers in the past few months, and have never heard of any account being banned or deleted after using our service.
		</p>
		<h3>What if it doesn’t work for me? Do you offer a money back guarantee?</h3>
		<p>
			Not to worry. Customer satisfaction always comes first to us. If we don’t deliver the committed number of followers/likes or if you are not satisfied with our services, feel free to request a money back ticket within 30 days of ordering our services. If your order hasn’t started within 72 hours, we offer 100% money back.
		</p>
		<h3>Do I need to give my Instagram username and password?</h3>
		<p>
			Not at all. Simply provide us with your Instagram username (via our website), and we will take care of the rest. No passwords or confidential information needed.
